90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: This and the JK version are the same text, I chose this one as it had some pre-tagging. 
    The edition has a rather distinctive layout with short lines (not poetry though) 
    which is largely lost in the digital version. 
    Otherwise pagination appears to be correct, although there are 46 pages that are marked as PageV00P000. 
    I have not corrected this, but noticed that the JK version does not have this issue. 
    It can likely be fixed with a script.  
    I have added a blank header for the introduction. 
    Footnote markers deleted. 
    Some Quranic verses (but not all) were marked between curly brackets, I have left this in place. 
    There were third level numberings in the digital version which I have deleted, 
    as they are not numbered or given section headers in the edition. 
    The numbering of the abwab was not consistent throughout the digital text. 
    As this would be an editorial addition I have deleted them from the digital text, 
    rather than trying to implement numbering in the abwab that didn't have them.

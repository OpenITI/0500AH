90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: There is a tag “NoteV00P037N05” in the text the last
    two digits of which show the overall number for names. I don’t know what
    it is, but it probably should be deleted (except the last two digits
    that is helpful). 2- The final section on the text (page 110 onwards) is
    “مستدركات” in which the editor has gathered some other sections of the
    text from other sources. I also tagged the names in this part.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)

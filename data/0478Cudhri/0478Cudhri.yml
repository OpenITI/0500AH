    al-ʿUdhrī "was born in Dalias, a village belonging to Almería.
    He travelled in 407/1016 with his father to Mecca, where he spent a
    number of years studying before returning to his homeland.
    Among his students in Andalusia are Ibn Ḥazm, Ibn ʿAbdalbarr and
    Abū ʿAbdallāh al-Ḥumaidī. He died in 478/1085 in Almería. His scientific
    interests were ḥadīth, history and geography. While his historic interest
    found its expression in a Kitāb Aʿlām al-nubuwwa or Dalā'il al-nubuwwa
    (not extant), he wrote a large book on geography with a tendency for mirabilia
    under the title Tarṣīʿ al-akhbār wa-tanwīʿ al-āthār wa-al-bustān fī gharā'ib al-buldān
    wa-al-masālik ilā jamīʿ al-mamālik. From this book, which was often used by later
    geographers like al-Idrīsī, Yāqūt and al-Qazwīnī, only the part on Andalusia
    is extant."

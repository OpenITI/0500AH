90#VERS#COMMENT##: Could not locate a pdf of edition used for the
        digital text (it seems to be a popular printing), so used the Dar al-
        Kutub version instead. Neither of these editions is on Worldcat. Text is
        broadly similar, and structure is mostly identical. However, the Dar al-
        Kutub version is still different: for example it includes eight sections
        between pp. 269-290 (these would be inserted between lines 2620-2621)
        which are entirely absent from the digital text. Other smaller
        differences which I have seen in the text indicate that this may  be due
        to divergent manuscript traditions. Where untagged titles in the digital
        text have the same wording as titles in the Dar al-Kutub  edition I have
        included them in the structure tags, but not where their wording is
        different. I inserted mARkdown tags for poetry through regex.
        NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): The first chapter (al-madkhal) is not written by
        the original author. It is written by the collector of the text (about whom
        see
        introduction, page22). So I removed the first-level tag for it and replace
        it
        with PARATEXT. 2- As this collector explains (and is written on the cover
        page
        of the PDF), the text is a collection of two books: “الظرائف واللطائف” and
        “اليواقيت في بعض المواقيت”. So, these texts should be separated into two
        files.
        I raised an issue for this. However, it is not clear from the structure
        where
        the second text begins, and I couldn’t understand this. Someone must read
        the
        text and its introduction closely. 3- This link is a PDF of the same edition
        as
        the digital version. It leads you to a payment-based website and you must
        have
        an account to see the PDF:
        https://www.noorlib.ir/View/fa/Book/BookView/Image/3584; A different old
        edition
        of the text is also accessible here: https://archive.org/details/999Pdf
        NB: check lines of poetry that seem too long: line numbers 1590
